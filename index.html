    <h2>Why coding and STEM?</h2>

    <p>
      In Georgia, women and girls are being left on the sidelines in STEM fields (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math).
    </p>

    <p>
      While girls score slightly higher than boys on Georgian exit exams in STEM subjects, they receive less support, are consistently less confident, and ultimately make up only 16% of university students in IT.
    </p>

    <p>
      Computer coding is important in every aspect of life, including medicine, community development, and economics.
